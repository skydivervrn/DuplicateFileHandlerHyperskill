<p>Bruno has a file called <em>songs.txt</em> with all his favorite songs. He wants to open the file in his Go program to read the data from it and then print it to the console.</p>
<p>Bruno has already written the required code to print the file contents to the console; however, he forgot how to properly open the file! Please help Bruno write the additional required code to open <em>songs.txt</em> and store it within the <code class="java">file</code> variable. Remember to implement error handling within the <code class="java">if</code> statement.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">This problem uses the <code class="java">bufio</code> package to scan the text contained within <em>songs.txt</em>. To solve this task, you don't need to know how the <code class="java">bufio</code> package works. The only objective is to open <em>songs.txt</em> and implement error handling within the <code class="java">if</code> statement.</div><p></p>
