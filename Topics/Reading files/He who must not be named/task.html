<p>Suppose you have a very large text file that contains the entire text of every Harry Potter book. In this file, each sentence of each novel is on a new line.</p>
<p>You want to write a program that splits the sentences into words, and counts the amount of times that the name <code class="java">"Voldemort"</code> is used. What is the optimal way to read this file?</p>
