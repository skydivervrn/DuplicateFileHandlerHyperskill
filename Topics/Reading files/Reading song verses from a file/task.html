<h2>Reading song verses from a file</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p>
<p>Patrick has received a text file <a href="https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/611467/technologic.txt" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><em>technologic.txt</em></a> with the first verse of Daft Punk's hit song Technologic.</p>
<p>He wants to print the contents of the file line by line in his Go program; this is the code he has written so far:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">package main

import (
    "bufio"
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "os"
)

func main () {
    file, err := os.Open("technologic.txt")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    defer file.Close()

    scanner := bufio.NewScanner(file)

    for scanner.Scan() {
        // What is the missing code line here to print the file contents?
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Please help him out by entering the missing code line below to print the file contents line by line:</p>
