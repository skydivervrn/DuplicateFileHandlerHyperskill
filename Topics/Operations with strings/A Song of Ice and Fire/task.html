<p>Your friend George Martin has completed the manuscript for part 7 of "A Song of Ice and Fire". But when he re-read it, he realized that he had mixed up the continent's name. Now, in his novel, instead of "Westeros" appeared "Misteros". We urgently need to replace all the names in the text.</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">This problem uses the <code class="java">bufio</code> and <code class="java">os</code> packages to read a string with white spaces or tabs from the input. To solve this task, you don't need to know how the <code class="java">bufio</code>/<code class="java">os</code> packages work; your only objective is to use the correct function from the <code class="java">strings</code> package that replaces substrings.</div><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">One day, the noble Jacques, who lived in Misteros, decided to move to another continent.
